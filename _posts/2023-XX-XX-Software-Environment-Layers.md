# Tip of the Week: Software Environment Layers

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

Code needs a consistent way to be used by computers. The "places" where code runs are generally called environments. Software environments have various layers and specific tools intended to ensure your code can run where it's needed. This article is the first in a series intended to cover the layers of where your code lives.

## Why this matters

Software environment management is crucial because [software decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot#Environment_change) may occur due to environmental change. If software is unable to be used due to the environment, it risks becoming meaningless to the audience. One way to think of this is as software shelter; code is unprotected and may fall victim to the elements without a home.

## Operating System Environment (Planetary Layer)

## Inter-System Environment (Solar System Layer)
