# Tip of the Week: Inter-lingual Data Engineering with Arrow and DuckDB

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a language-independent and high performance data format useful in many scenarios. [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an in-process [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)-based data management system which is Arrow-compatible. DuckDB provides a standardized and highly performant way to work with Arrow data where otherwise one may be forced to language-specific data structures or transforms.

__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__
DuckDB may be used to access and transform Arrow-based data from multiple data formats through SQL. Using DuckDB in this way may provide improvements in performance, understandability, or long term maintainability of your code.
