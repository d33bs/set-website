# Tip of the Week: Diagrams as Code

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

Diagrams can be a useful way to illuminate and communicate ideas. Free-form drawing or drag and drop tools are one common way to create diagrams. With this tip of the week we introduce another option: diagrams as code (DaC), or creating diagrams by using code.

__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__
Diagrams as code (DaC) tools provide an advantage for illustrating concepts by enabling __quick visual positioning__, __source controllable input__, __portability (both for input and output formats)__, and __open collaboration through reproducibility__. Consider trying or using the following diagrams as code tools: [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/), [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), or [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/).
